    <h1>Waxy, Hairy Crops</h1>
    <h3>Research into grass epidermis biology can help improve the world's cereal crops</h3>
    <h5>Nelson D. Young</h5>
    <h2><br>Introduction</h2>
    <p>One of the greatest needs in agriculture is to discover or develop crops that can grow in hot, dry locations, such as the margins of deserts. There are a number of traits that help a plant cope with arid climate. These are summed up well in this article, “How Plants Cope with Drought and Low Water Conditions” <cite><a href=ref.html#Rfinehout>[Rfinehout]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>When the World Atlas of Desertification<cite><a href=ref.html#Atlas>[Atlas]</a></cite> was released in 2018, it showed that we have already made much of our farm land into desert, and that we will lose another 10% by 2050. There is a clear need, not only for political and social change to stop this disaster, but also for developing crops that can grow with less water and/or tolerate a period of drought.
    </p>
    <p>Plants need water to produce good yields; we can't change that fact. However, crops with less demand for water can be developed &#9461; by revising their physiology to use water more efficiently or &#9462; by revising the morphology and composition of their epidermis to reduce water loss.  Many traits can contribute to succesful growth in hot, dry places, including:

            cell and leaf osmotic properties<br>
            reduced stomatal conductance<br>
            thicker cuticle<br>
            fewer stomata<br>
            denser trichomes<br>
            et cetera
        </h3>   
    </div>
    <p>
        Cereal crops are the most important source of food we have, making up over half of the calories consumed worldwide <cite><a href=ref.html#Awika>[Awika, 2011]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>Drought tolerance, which might be better named &#147;dehydration tolerance,&#148; is a &#147;strategy allowing plants to tolerate low tissue level of dehydration (>30% water)&#148; <cite><a href =ref.html#Volaire>[Volaire, 2018]</a></cite></p>
    <p>
        If farmers can predict annual dry periods, they can plant crops that are harvested before the drought occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        But drought periods are often unpredictable.
    </p>
    <p>
        In areas where moisture is unreliable, they need crops that respond well. In years where sufficient moisture is available the plant should produce high yields  <em>and,</em> during drought, it should switch strategies so as to <em>survive</em> and still produce <em>some</em> yield. In other words, tolerate drought, when measured by yield.
    </p>
    <p class= "quoted">
        &#147;A range of morphological and physiological traits have been linked to drought tolerance in plants, which include root morphology and rooting depth, plant architecture, leaf area, cuticular resistance and thickness, stomatal conductance, osmotic adjustment, antioxidative defense, hormonal regulation, dessication tolerance (membrane and protein stability), and maintenance of photosynthesis through persistent green leaf area (stay-green<cite><a id="Kassahun" href              =ref.html#Kassahun>[Kassahun et al., 2010]</a></cite>).&#148; <cite><a href=ref.html#Madhus>[Madhusudana, 2019]</a></cite>. 
    <p>
        QTLs and candidate genes have now been identified for drought tolerance in many crops, including rice, wheat, barley, sorghum and millet <cite><a href=ref.html#Mir>[Mir et al., 2012]</a></cite>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sorghum and millet are more drought-tolerant than most other crops and can thus provide a reliable source of income or food security in arid regions with variable climates <cite><a href  =ref.html#Mukarumba>[Mukarumba et al., 2010]</a></cite>, where most farmers rely on rain, rather than irrigation<cite><a href=ref.html#Hadebe>[Hadebe et al. 2017]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sorghum has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it use water efficiently<cite><a href=ref.html#Hadebe>[Hadebe et al. 2017]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Research in millet has shown that many traits     contribute to drought tolerance <cite><a href="ref.html#Serba">[Serba and Yadav, 2016]</a></cite> and QTLs are beginning to be identified, including one for low transpiration rate <cite><a href=ref.html#Kholová>[Kholová et al 2012]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For drought <em>tolerance,</em> it's really not critical for a crop plant to constantly express traits that serve it well in drought conditions, only that it be able to <em>respond</em> to such conditions by displaying the trait(s). Sorghum can respond to dry conditions in the soil and air by partially closing stomata, rolling leaves and using a narrow leaf angle to present less surface area to solar radiation. It also uses osmotic adjustment to &#147;maintain higher leaf relative water content at low leaf water potential&#148; <cite><a href=ref.html#Hadebe>[Hadebe et al. 2017]</a></cite>.

    <h3 id="grain set">
        Drought stress in cereals can greatly reduce the quality of the grain set.</h3>
    <p>
        Especially if the drought occurs during flowering, even a short drought can severely damage yield.<cite><a href=ref.html#Barnabas>[Barnabás, et al., 2008]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many morphological and physiological methods for coping with dry locations. Let's start with physiology.
    </p>
    <h2 id="physiology">
        <br>Physiological Adaptations to Drought
    </h2>
    <p>
        Many physiological adaptations have been described <cite><a href=ref.html#Xoco>[Xoconostle-Cázares et al., 2010]</a></cite>. </p>
    <p>
        Response to drought shares many similarities to other abiotic stresses, such as heat, cold, salinity and wounding. It includes, among other things, an increase in the plant hormone Abscisic Acid (ABA) <cite><a href=ref.html#Tuteja>[Tuteja, 2007]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <em>Arabidopsis,</em> drought-stress inducible genes have a variety of functions <cite><a href=ref.html#Shinozaki>[Shinozaki, et al. 2007]</a></cite>.
    </p>
     <figure class = "sidecap">
        <img src="functions.png" alt="drought gene functions" title ="drought gene functions" style="width:480px;">
        <figcaption>
            &#147;Functions of drought stress-inducible genes in stress tolerance and response. Gene products are classified into two groups. The first group includes proteins that probably function in stress tolerance (functional proteins), and the second group contains protein factors involved in further regulation of signal transduction and gene expression that probably function in stress response (regulatory proteins).
            &#148; <cite><a href=ref.html#Shinozaki>[Shinozaki, et al. 2007]</a></cite>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Drought can provoke multiple pathways: some that use ABA and some that are ABA-independent.
    </p>
         <figure class = "sidecap">
        <img src="six_paths.png" alt="6 regulatory paths" title ="6 regulatory paths" style="width:600px;">
        <figcaption>
            &#147;Transcriptional regulatory networks of abiotic stress signals and gene expression. At least six signal transduction pathways exist in drought, high salinity, and cold-stress responses: three are ABA dependent and three are ABA independent. In the ABA-dependent pathway, ABRE functions as a major ABA-responsive element. AREB/ABFs are AP2 transcription factors involved in this process. MYB2 and MYC2 function in ABA-inducible gene expression of the <em>RD22</em> gene. MYC2 also functions in JA-inducible gene expression. The RD26 NAC transcription factor is involved in ABA- and JA-responsive gene expression in stress responses. These MYC2 and NAC transcription factors may function in cross-talk during abiotic-stress and wound-stress responses. In one of the ABA-independent pathways, DRE is mainly involved in the regulation of genes not only by drought and salt but also by cold stress. DREB1/CBFs are involved in cold-responsive gene expression. DREB2s are important transcription factors in dehydration and high salinity stress-responsive gene expression. Another ABA-independent pathway is controlled by drought and salt, but not by cold. The NAC and HD-ZIP transcription factors are involved in <em>ERD1</em> gene expression.&#148; <cite><a href=ref.html#Shinozaki>[Shinozaki, et al. 2007]</a></cite>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Regulation of the drought response is even more complex than the above figure suggests, for mRNA degradation and post-translational modification can have as much impact as transcriptiopnal regulation, as proteomics studies in <em>Sorghum</em> have revealed <cite><a href=ref.html#Jedmowski>[Jedmowski et al., 2014]</a></cite>.

    <p>
        &#147;Early vigor, defined as an increase in the above-ground biomass prior to stem elongation, is a beneficial trait . . . Since vapor pressure is low in winter, increased biomass during early growth improves plant water use efficiency.&#148;<cite><a href=ref.html#Bertolino>[Bertolino, et al. 2019]</a></cite>.

        <br>Morphology and Composition of the Epidermis
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although physiology is undeniably important, I would like to focus my work on the epidermis and its morphology and composition. And I would like to utilize the Hazen and Caicedo labs expertise with <em>Brachypodium</em> diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, a review of some of the major ways in which the epidermis adapts to drought.
    </p>
    <h3 id="stomata">More-sheltered or fewer stomata can save water</h3>
    <p>
        Stomatal density and morphology can be useful changes for a desert plant <cite><a href=ref.html#Bertolino>[Bertolino, et al. 2019]</a></cite>.
    </p>
     <h3 id = "wax">Cuticular Wax Thickness and Composition</h3>
    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thickness of the cuticle affects water loss</h4>
    <p>
        The cuticle is the "skin" of a plant. It is made up of cutin, suberin and wax, all hydrophobic polymers and mixtures derived from fats. It mediates the plant's interactions with the environment. Plants frequently respond to drought conditions by increasing the thickness of their cuticle <cite><a href=ref.html#Borisjuk>[Borisjuk, et al., 2014]</a></cite>. They also respond to high salinity with a thicker cuticle, which can also help plants grow in some marginal areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        At least 13 genes responsible for regulating cuticle formation have been found in <em>Arabidopsis</em>, but finding one whose over-expression does more good than harm can be challenging.
        &#147;ectopic over-expression of <em>WIN1/SHN1</em> in transgenic <em>Arabidopsis</em> plants produced characteristic undesirable alterations in phenotype, such as stunted growth, strongly curved leaves, delayed flowering time, large numbers of infertile flowers and consequently, a lower production of seeds compared to wild type plants.&#148; However, many of these side-effects may be due to the use of foreign promoters in the experiment. When native promoters are used, many of those effects no longer appear 
        <cite><a href=ref.html#Borisjuk>[Borisjuk, et al., 2014]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In grasses, increases in cuticular wax thickness due to drought has also been observed. <cite><a href=ref.html#Shepherd>[Shepherd and Wynne Griffiths, 2006]</a></cite>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, wax thickness may not be as important as composition. This was found in a study on wheat. &#147;The relationship between the cuticle and drought tolerance is not simple and glaucousness is not a unique indicator of tolerance. Rather, specific wax composition, in particular the presence of significant proportions of C31 β-diketone, adaptive changes in composition and amount induced by exposure to drought and wax crystal structure will all influence leaf water loss under conditions of water deficit. These features of cuticle composition and deposition appear important and should provide useful selection criteria although they are more difficult to measure than glaucousness.&#148; <cite><a href=ref.html#Huihui>[Huihui, et al. 2017]</a></cite>
    </p>
    <p>
        See Bourgault, et al.<cite><a href=ref.html#Bourg>[2020]</a></cite> for a review of how maize leaves develop their cuticle's water barrier during development.
    </p>
    <p>
        The genetic control of cuticle development is being elucidated in maize, where they have identified seven genes that seem to be involved in cuticle building. Some of these genes transport lipids into the cuticle from the adjacent cells' plasma membranes. One other probably regulates the biosynthesis of alkanes, and yet another helps with cuticular formation by hydrolyzing mono-, di- and triglycerols to release free fatty acids and alcohols. Finally, one is a β-D-xylosidase, which (although they didn't say in the article) may be restructuring the hemicellulose in the cuticle, which could conceivably affect permeability (again, I'm speculating)<cite><a href=ref.html#Lin>[Lin, et al. 2020]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollen Cuticle</h4>
    <p>
        Water loss from pollen in hot, dry conditions might be as important as water loss from the leaves. Such high-temperature male sterility has been observed in many crops, including barley, wheat and rice. &#147;In many such instances, male sterility relates to defects in development of the pollen protective coat&#148;
        <cite><a href=ref.html#Borisjuk>[Borisjuk, et al., 2014]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several <em>Arabidopsis</em> mutants that affect cuticle wax thickness have been discovered. &#147;The mutants produce viable pollen, which, however, fails to hydrate on the dry stigma because of alterations in the amount and composition of the pollen coat lipids. Therefore, protecting of plant reproductive organs during stress, using cuticle-related TFs directed by tissue-specific promoters, could be yet another powerful application of biotechnological intervention&#148; <cite><a href=ref.html#Borisjuk>[Borisjuk, et al., 2014]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="perm prob">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permeability is important
    </h4>
    <p>
        Although reducing cuticle permeability might aid in drought resistance, it is likely to have consequences, as permeability is important for plants to detect and respond to attack. <cite><a href=ref.html#Serrano>[Serrano, et al. 2014]</a><a href =ref.html#Ziv>[Ziv et al., 2018]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="arid">Trichomes help plants resist drying out
    </h3>
    <p>
        Plant hairs, otherwise known as trichomes, aid in three ways. &#9461; In some plants they can absorb moisture from the morning dew. Their shape, arrangement and density can also play a role in &#9462; shading the surface of the plant and in &#9463; reducing surface airflow, which, in turn, reduces evaporative water loss.
        <cite><a href=ref.html#Bickford>[Bickford, 2016]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ratio of trichomes to stomata (per unit leaf surface area) increases under water-deficit conditions in tomato <cite><a href=ref.html#Galdon>[Galdon-Almero et al., 2018]</a></cite>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In barley, it was found that drought stress increases both the density and size of trichomes <cite><a href=ref.html#Liu>[Liu &amp; Liu, 2016]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In wheat, the same relationships were found. <cite><a href=ref.html#Pshenichnikova>[Pshenichnikova et al., 2018]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="morphology">Trichome Morphology</h3>
    <p>
        Trichomes come in a variety of size and shapes, from projections much smaller than a cell, up to multicellular structures. Some are branched. Some have glands.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best studied are the non-glandular, branched trichomes of the mouse-ear cress, <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>
    </p>
    <p>Read about <a href="arabidopsis.html">Trichome genetics in <em>Arabidopsis</em> (mouse-ear cress)</a></p>
    <p>However, the genetic regulation of trichome development in many of the world's most important crop plants is apparently quite different from the <em>Arabidopsis</em> case. It seems unlikely that the molecular biology of regulation in <em>Arabidopsis,</em> a rosid, is shared widely among plants. It is rather different in the asterids <cite><a href=ref.html#Serna>[Serna, et al. 2006]</a></cite>. Some debate on this??</p>
    <p>Read about Trichome genetics in <a href="maize.html">maize</a> and <a href="rice.html">rice.</a></p>
    
    <p>
        However, even though the regulation of trichome development may not be widely conserved among distantly-related plant groups, it is possible that the regulation of trichome initiation is better-conserved. So it may be worth considering the work being done in this area with the glandular trichomes of tomato and wormwood. <a href="glandular.html">More info</a>

    <h2><br>The genus <em>Brachypodium</em> contains xeric-adapted species</h2>
    <p>
        The annual <em>B. distachyon, B. stacei, B. hybridum</em> and the perennial <em>B. retusum</em> and <em>B. boissieri</em> are xeric-adapted species <cite><a href=ref.html#Scholthof>[Scholthof et al, 2018]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <h2><br>The <em>Brachypodium</em> model system</h2>
    <p><em>Brachypodium</em> nows serves as a model system for studying grasses <cite><a href=ref.html#Kellogg>[Kellogg, 2015]</a></cite><cite><a href=ref.html#Scholthof>[Scholthof et al, 2018]</a></cite>, in general, and is close enough evolutionarily, to important food crops such as wheat and barley, as well as important biofuel crops such a switchgrass, which can be used to produce energy.
    </p>
    <p>The genome has been sequenced and resources have been developed that allow study of gene expression <cite><a href=ref.html#IBI>[IBI 2010]</a></cite>.  <em>Brachypodium</em> tissue samples can be assayed to see which genes are being expressed. A study of the response of <em>Brachypodium</em> to heat, high salinity, drought, and cold stress has been published <cite><a href=ref.html#Priest>[Priest et al., 2014]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>Some accessions of <em>Brachypodium distachyon</em> are more drought-adapted than others, which opens <a href="distachyon_xeric.html">avenues of study</a>.
    </p>
    <h2><br>Association Studies Can Suggest Answers</h2>
    <p>
        It might also be wise to take an empirical approach and ask, "When grass populations adapt to drought, what changes do we see?"
    </p>
    <p>
        Many <em>Brachypodium distachyon</em> individuals have been sequenced, from throughout the species' range, providing a great resource for genetic study.
    </p>    
    <p>
        For example, if we compare different populations of <em>Brachypodium distachyon,</em> as was done by Tyler et al, 2016 <cite><a href=ref.html#Tyler>[Tyler et al., 2016]</a></cite> for flowering time differences, but with an eye towards drought adaptations instead, the underlying genetic differences could be discovered.
