    <h2>Drought adaptation in <em>Brachypodium distachyon</em></h2>
    
    <p>Unlike crop plants, which may have lost many of their drought-coping strategies during domestication and a long history of growth with irrigation, <em>B. distachyon</em> is a wild species, many populations of which inhabit dry regions.</p>
    <p>There are many drought-tolerant <em>B. distachyon</em> accessions known <cite><a href=ref.html#Ruiz>[Ruiz et al., 2016]</a></cite>, as well as other populations adapted to wetter climates. Dell'Acqua et al. studied populations in a transect across Turkey from western populations adapted to lower, wetter conditions to eastern populations adapted to higher and drier conditions. They found a number of genetic differences associated with this change of climate <cite><a href=ref.html#Dell>[Dell'Acqua et al., 2014]</a></cite>
    </p>
    <p>In looking for what genes might better help plants adapt to dry conditions, it is also relevant to examine how plants cope with drought stress. Many candidate genes have been identified<cite><a href=ref.html#Priest>[Priest et al., 2014]</a></cite>  <cite><a href=ref.html#Verelst>[Verelst et al., 2013]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some drought stress responses trade off growth and reproduction for immediate survival, so they may not be traits that are desirous in crop improvement, but other traits may hold promise.
    </p>

        Changes in cell wall composition can also make <em>Brachypodium distachyon</em> more drought tolerant. A major component of this drought tolerance comes from &#147;relative abundance and remodeling of xyloglucan tethers between the cellulose microfibrils.&#148; <cite><a href=ref.html#Lenk>[Lenk et al., 2019]</a></cite>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hairiness (trichome density and size) is variable within <em>Brachypodium distachyon,</em> even in different parts of Turkey, although I couldn't find which populations are hairier and which less, as the data wasn't included in the research article <cite><a href=ref.html#Filiz>[Filiz et al., 2009]</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, <em>Brachypodium stacei,</em> a very close relative of <em>Brachypodium distachyon</em> <cite><a href=ref.html#Catalan>[Catalán et al., 2016]</a><a href=ref.html#Catalan12>[Catalán et al., 2012]</a></cite>, is very hairy, suggesting the possibility that genes for hairiness exist in <em>B. distachyon,</em> but are repressed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps <em>Brachypodium stacei</em> will be found to have higher levels of expresion than <em>Brachypodium distachyon</em>, for some of the trichome genes (known for rice, maize and <em>Arabidopsis.</em>)
